them in a stock pot.\nTo the chicken in the pot, add the water (water should mostly cover the chicken), bouillon, bay leaf, onion, bell pepper and garlic.\nPlace the stock pot over medium high heat and bring to a boil; reduce the heat to medium, cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove pot from the heat.\nRemove chicken quarters from the pot and

cup (250ml) of the liquid from the stock pot and set aside.\nReturn the stock pot to medium heat and bring to a simmer. \n \nPlace the flour into a small bowl.\nWhile stirring constantly, gradually add the reserved liquid to the flour until a smooth paste is formed.\nPour the paste into the stock pot and stir constantly until the mixture starts to thicken.\nAdd the beans, chopped chicken, chili powder, coriander and cumin.\nIncrease the heat to medium and, stirring frequently, simmer, uncovered for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nReduce the heat to low and add the fresh coriander, single cream and soured cream.\nStir well until the single and soured creams are completely incorporated into the chili.\nAdd pepper to taste.\nServe immediately.\nGarnish with chopped avocado, spring onion, fresh coriander or grated cheese.\nLike most soups, this chili is great refrigerated and served the next day but if you intend

Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F.

Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.\nDissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar. Stir together, then let sit 10 minutes.\nAdd the Coach Oats mixture to yeast mixture and add the butter, salt, molasses, honey, wheat germ and milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and with the paddle attachment, mix together to combine.\nAdd the one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of the all purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.\nWith the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.\nAfter two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so. If it is still sticking to the sides, add about 1/4 cup more flour, let it mix. Keep adding a little flour at a time until the ball of dough no longer sticks to the sides. Let it knead for 8-10 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the bowl from the mixer.\nTake the dough out of the bowl and spray it with cooking spray. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry place for an hour until doubled in size (mine took almost 2 hours).\nPunch down the dough and make 2.50 ounce sized balls of doughyoull get about 19 rolls. Set them on a baking sheet and cover with a tea towel. Let them rise for about 45 minutes.\nDuring the last 20 minutes of rise time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nFill a dutch oven or oven safe pot with water and place on the lowest shelf of the oven, this will add steam in the oven.\nBrush each roll with egg wash. Bake the rolls for 17-23 minutes (you may have to do this in two batches, unless you have a huge oven). Let the rolls sit on the baking sheet sit for a few minutes, then remove rolls from pan and place on a wire rack to  cool completely.\nNOTE:  Due to the molasses, the rolls will have a brown tone, so when your baking them, make sure the bottom has a light brown color to them, at first I thought I was over cooking the rolls, and I wasnt, 19 minutes seemed to be perfect amount of time.\nServing Size: 19  2.5 oz rolls\nCalories per roll:  145,  Fat:  1.2,  Cholesterol:  .03,  Sodium:  20,  Potassium:  117,  Carbs:  29,  Fiber:  3,  Sugar:  3.8,  Protein:  4.9","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a small saucepan, bring the 1 cup water and the Coaches Oats to a boil, turn down to medium low and simmer for about 6 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"},{"id":8120,"name":"oats","localizedName":"oats","image":"rolled-oats.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}],"length":{"number":6,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":2,"step":"Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Dissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar.
