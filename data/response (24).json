cup (250ml) of the liquid from the stock pot and set aside.\nReturn the stock pot to medium heat and bring to a simmer. \n \nPlace the flour into a small bowl.\nWhile stirring constantly, gradually

Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven. I left the organs and the neck for added flavor.\n2. Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken\n3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.\nSalsa Verde\n1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don't worry if you can't wash it all off. Remove the stems.\n2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.\n3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.\n4. It's as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you're eating!\nTamale Dough (Masa)\nMix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.\nSalsa Verde Tamales\nTamale Dough\nShreded chicken\n2 cups Salsa Verde\n10 to 40 green olives\n4 medium potatoes\n1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.\n2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.\n3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.\n4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.\n5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.\n6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.\n7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.\n8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used.\n9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.\n10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't.\n11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.\n12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roasted Chicken","ingredients":[{"id":5114,"name":"roasted chicken","localizedName":"roasted chicken","image":"rotisserie-chicken.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven.

Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls.

As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\nNow you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.

(Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)\nTo prepare the cheesecake\nIn a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.\nCream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.\nStir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.\nFinally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.\nPour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.\nRemove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)\nAllow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature.
