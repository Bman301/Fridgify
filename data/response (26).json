Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas.

Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.

Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven. I left the organs and the neck for added flavor.\n2. Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken\n3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.\nSalsa Verde\n1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don't worry if you can't wash it all off. Remove the stems.\n2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.\n3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.\n4. It's as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you're eating!\nTamale Dough (Masa)\nMix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.\nSalsa Verde Tamales\nTamale Dough\nShreded chicken\n2 cups Salsa Verde\n10 to 40 green olives\n4 medium potatoes\n1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.\n2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.\n3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don't have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.\n4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don't have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.\n5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.\n6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.\n7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.\n8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can't remember the exact amount I used.\n9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.\n10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don't.\n11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.\n12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later. Simply let them defrost and steam until warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Roasted Chicken","ingredients":[{"id":5114,"name":"roasted chicken","localizedName":"roasted chicken","image":"rotisserie-chicken.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven.

As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.\nOnce your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.\nNow you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.\nTake the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.\nRoll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.\nThe final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.\nDrop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.\nRemove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.
