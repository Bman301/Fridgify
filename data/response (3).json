To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Foley Estate Winery Sta. Rita Hills Chardonnay with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":473912,"title":"Foley Estate Winery Sta.
