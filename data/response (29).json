Oil should be about 375 degrees OR when a cube of bread is dropped in the oil, it will brown in 1 minute.\nAdd rice balls to hot oil and brown on all sides.  This may have to be done in stages--do NOT crowd the pan!  Fry maybe 6-8 balls at a time so they have plenty of room to move around in the pan.

Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.\nIn the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.\nPlace a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).\nPour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.\nCook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.\nI usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.\nTo keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.\nSo, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.\nWhen you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined.","ingredients":[{"id":1123,"name":"egg","localizedName":"egg","image":"egg.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404726,"name":"blender","localizedName":"blender","image":"blender.png"},{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":30,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":4,"step":"Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.","ingredients":[{"id":1077,"name":"milk","localizedName":"milk","image":"milk.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).","ingredients":[{"id":1001,"name":"butter","localizedName":"butter","image":"butter-sliced.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404764,"name":"pastry brush","localizedName":"pastry brush","image":"pastry-brush.jpg"},{"id":404645,"name":"frying pan","localizedName":"frying pan","image":"pan.png"}]},{"number":6,"step":"Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan.

Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm.\nDissolve the yeast in a medium sized bowl with 1/3 cup warm water and the sugar. Stir together, then let sit 10 minutes.\nAdd the Coach Oats mixture to yeast mixture and add the butter, salt, molasses, honey, wheat germ and milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and with the paddle attachment, mix together to combine.\nAdd the one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of the all purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.\nWith the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.\nAfter two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so. If it is still sticking to the sides, add about 1/4 cup more flour, let it mix. Keep adding a little flour at a time until the ball of dough no longer sticks to the sides. Let it knead for 8-10 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the bowl from the mixer.\nTake the dough out of the bowl and spray it with cooking spray. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry place for an hour until doubled in size (mine took almost 2 hours).\nPunch down the dough and make 2.50 ounce sized balls of doughyoull get about 19 rolls. Set them on a baking sheet and cover with a tea towel. Let them rise for about 45 minutes.\nDuring the last 20 minutes of rise time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nFill a dutch oven or oven safe pot with water and place on the lowest shelf of the oven, this will add steam in the oven.\nBrush each roll with egg wash. Bake the rolls for 17-23 minutes (you may have to do this in two batches, unless you have a huge oven).

Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.\nBegin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.\nReduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.\nRolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"Make the pastry","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill.
