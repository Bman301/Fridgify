When pairing wine with Spanish dishes, why not follow the rule 'what grows together goes together'? We recommend albariño for white wine and garnachan and tempranillo for red. One wine you could try is Matchbook Tempranillo. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":453462,"title":"Matchbook Tempranillo","description":"The 2013 Matchbook Tempranillo unfurls with Old World characteristics from two standout Spanish clones. The Ribera del Duero and Tinta de Toro vines grown on our estate contribute the familiar varietal flavors, while the traditional Rioja blending grape Graciano adds tannin and structure. Pronounced aromatics of ripe raspberry and rich plum lead to enticing flavors of earth, spicy cardamom and dark fruit. Smooth and soft on the palate, this seductive red has a bright finish that begs for another sip of this finely structured wine. Pair this Dunnigan Hills Tempranillo with a traditional Paella dish infused with saffron, mussels, shrimp and chorizo.","price":"$14.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/453462-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8574999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatchbook-tempranillo-2010%2F128990"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.
