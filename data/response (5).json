Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 26 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435394,"title":"Chehalem 3 Vineyard Pinot Gris","description":"Perfectly balanced between rich and refreshing, bright and subtle, and slightly sweet and slightly tart. The nose shows characteristic fleshy white peach, fruit cocktail, sweet Rainier cherries, and a sprinkling of delicate pollen. The mouth is where the follow-through completes, skating lines of balance from a touch of residual sugar and lemon-zest acidity; both brightness and weight from a bit of alcohol and some slight pear-skin-like phenolics on the mid-palate; and length of finish and supple softer fruit on the end. Ripe melon, honeysuckle, pineapple and nectarine all make an appearance. Great with food, or just with a glass.","price":"$25.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435394-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":9.0,"score":0.8442857142857144,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fchehalem-3-vineyard-pinot-gris-2014%2F150759"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>Stem and seed the aji chilies and chop to achieve a smooth paste.</li><li>In a mixing bowl combine the 100% pure honey and the chile paste with salt to taste.</li><li>In a hot skillet over medium heat, cook the chiles de arbol careful not to burn them.
