Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Season both sides of the corned beef liberally with pepper.
