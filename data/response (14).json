Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.

Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.

Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.

Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls.

Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic.

Add a little bit of olive oil to your frying pan, add chicken, and cook through. Remove chicken from pan, then add diced onions to the pan. Turn heat to medium and let onions saute through. (You may need to add a little bit more oil to the pan.)</li><li>Meanwhile, chop up your chicken (or shred) very finely. When the onions are soft and translucent, add chicken back to the pan. Season your onions and chicken with garlic, cumin, and chili powder. Finely chop up your jalapeno and add that and your green chilis to your chicken mixture. Stir in your cheese. Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side. Doing this softens your tortilla so it won't break as you roll it. Do this with all your tortillas and drain on paper towels.</li><li>Take 2 cookie sheets and spray with cooking spray. Lay out a tortilla and add about 2 TBSP of chicken mixture to the middle of your tortilla. Roll up. Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching.

Sprinkle flour over and toss the meat around to coat lightly. With a large pot over high heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil. Wait for about a minute until the pot is really hot and add your beef (otherwise your meat will stay a grey color instead of a nice golden brown. If you do not have a large pot, do your beef in batches so as not to crowd the pot). Cook for about 5 minutes and turn the meat over. Cook for another 3-4 minutes until you get a nice color and remove from the pot (do not turn off the heat). Put aside in a bowl.\nAdd 1 tbsp olive oil to the pot and add onions, carrots, thyme and rosemary. Cook for about 7 minutes (stir frequently to keep the bottom of the pot from burning).

You should roll half of pastry for the bottom side of cakes and half of pastry for upper side off the cakes. The size should be just a little bigger than the size of your baking dish.\nBake the pastry for about 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool the upper layer completely. Leave the second one (bottom layer) in the baking dish.\nDivide egg yolks from egg whites, putting egg whites in to the larger bowl.\nFor the egg yolk mixture, add sugar, vanilla and rum to the egg yolks into a smaller bowl. Mix them together for a minute or two. Add flour and 1/4 off milk and mix together to get a smooth mixture.\nMix egg whites in the large bowl until firm consistency. Then add sugar and mix again. The consistency after adding the sugar should be very firm.\nPut the rest of the milk in to a large cooking pot and bring it to boiling point. Take a whisk and slowly pour the egg yolk mixture in to boiling milk, whisking the whole time. Cook it for 5 minutes, whisking the whole time. After 5 minutes the consistency should be thick and very hard for you to whisk.\nNOW THE CRUCIAL AN THE HARDEST PART  IT IS BETTER THAT TWO PERSONS DO THIS\nTake the boiling mixture of the stove. Pour it in into egg whites very slowly at first. Whisk the whole time.  When you see both mixtures getting nicely mixed together in to a thicker mixture pour the boiling mixture faster into egg whites, until the end.
