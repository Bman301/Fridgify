We had this for lunch the following day. You can heat the shrimp up a bit in a hot pan or serve cold in this salad. The base is baby arugula, topped with half a sliced avocado, the grilled shrimp, plum tomato and a slice of turkey bacon (my fav, Applegate brand turkey bacon! No nitrates or nitrites added). Dressed super simply with lime juice and a drizzle of olive oil.</li></ol>"
